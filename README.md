# NBA-Lottery-Odds
Here I use Python to generate the NBA Lottery draft odds

This is another project I did for fun: I built a nested for loop that will generate the probability matrix associated with the NBA draft lottery. The goal is to produce the same chart that is displayed in this wikipedia article (Scroll down to 2019) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft_lottery. It's a tough conditional probability problem to tackle. It almost made me quit quite a few times but I stuck with it. I think its really cool!
